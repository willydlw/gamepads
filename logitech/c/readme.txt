*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

Instructions: 	The Makefile in this directory creates an executable named etest

1. Folder receive_bytes contains the following files:

	main.c
	logitech.c
	logitech.h
	Makefile
	readme.txt

Follow steps 2 - 5 to build the shared object library files, install the library, configure
the cache, and include it in the searchable library path.

2. Build the executable

    Compile the program and build the object .o and executable files:
    % make


3. Run the program
   % ./etest



To clean the files: make clean
